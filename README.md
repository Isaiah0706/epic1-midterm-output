Hello! Mandala art is a Sanskrit word for “magic circle”. 
People believed that Mandalas represent different aspects of the universe and are used as instruments of meditation and symbols of prayer most noticeably in China, Japan, and Tibet.
Mandala art is very popular like other famous paintings in history.
